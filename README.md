# Chat-Interface-with-Image-Generation

This project involves creating a chat interface that interacts with an AI model to generate responses based on user input. The interface will be created using the Panel library, and the AI model will be accessed via the Mistral API. Additionally, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) UI will be incorporated to answer questions based on context from uploaded text files.
